This document aims to describe how to use the DOS_visualize script

The user can directly use the DOS_visualize script or create a second script to import 
the DOS_visualize class. After importing and instantiating the class, the user will need to run the 
plot_dos command on the DOS_visualize instance.

The DOS_visualize object is instantiated with the input files and the types of DOS's you want to plot.
One subplot is created per jdos file. Currently the script does not re-plotting the same jdos file. 
It can be worked around by making a copy of the file and naming it something different.

The jdos files are generated from the dosUp and dosDn files output from a JDFTx singlepoint calculation.
It is recommended to create the jdos files from the desired dosUp and dosDn files in a node computer and then
run the python script locally to plot. The plots cannot be run on CU Bouler's Alpine because MatPlotLib is missing
a required package to save figures.

The way the class is instantiated selects which files to scan through, elements/atoms, and orbitals to plot.
the files are specified in a list: files=['practice.json','practice_2.json']

The atoms are then specified in a nested list, where the parent list corresponds to each file and the child list
corresponds to which atoms should be plotted from that file. Specifiy an atomic symbol without a number will plot 
the pDOS of every atom of that element. For example: Ar_1 plots the pDOS of the first Ar atom in the JDFTx output files,
but Ar plots the pDOS of every argon atom in the unit cell.

If one wanted to plot all the Na and Cl atoms separately it would look like this:
Atoms=[['Na'],['Cl']]
There is also the option to use 'Total', which will plot the entire DOS for the material without projecting onto 
certain sites.

Orbitals can also be specified. If you want to plot all the orbitals of a specific atom/element, set orbitals as 'all'
There is currently no default for this so if orbitals are not specified, the script will break.

Orbitals are specified in a twice nested list where the grandparent is the file, the parent is the atom and the child is the orbital.
Accepted orbitals are: ['s','p','d','f','s','px','py','pz','dxy','dxz','dyz','dz2','dx2-y2','fy3','fz3','fx3','fyz2-x2','fzx2-y2','fxz2-y2','fxyz'] 
or ['all']

to plot all the Na atoms' s orbitals and all of the first chlorine atom's orbitals from practice.json, the command would look like this:
DOS_visualize(file=['NaCl.json'], Atoms=[['Na','Cl_1']], orbitals=[[['s'],['all']]])


An example script is shown below:

from DOS_visualize import DOS_visualize

dos = DOS_visualize(files=['practice.json'], 
                           Atoms=[['Ir']],
                            orbitals=[['s','d']],
                            path='C:/Users/user/github/JDFT_tools/DOS_visualize'
                            )
dos.plot_dos()
